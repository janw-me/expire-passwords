Harden the security of your site by preventing unauthorized access to stale user accounts.

This plugin is also ideal for sites needing to meet certain industry security compliances - such as government, banking or healthcare.

In the plugin settings you can set the maximum number of days users are allowed to use the same password (90 days by default), as well as which user roles will be required to reset their passwords regularly (non-Administrators by default).

**Languages supported:**

* English
* Czech
* Español

**Development of this plugin is done [on GitHub](https://github.com/Miller-Media/expire-passwords). Pull requests welcome. Please see [issues reported](https://github.com/Miller-Media/expire-passwords/issues) there before going to the plugin forum.**

== Screenshots ==

1. Configure which user roles should be required to regularly reset their passwords and how often.
2. Users with expired passwords are redirected to the password reset screen upon sign in.
3. Users are not permitted to use the same password two times in a row during reset.
